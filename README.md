# Android Bootcamp: Instagram Photo Viewer

This is a read-only photo viewer for Instagram which allows a user to checkout out popular photos.

Time spent: 5+5+4+2+1=17 hours spent in total.

Completed user stories:

 * [x] Required: User can scroll through current popular photos from Instagram
 * [x] Required: For each photo displayed, user can see the following details: Graphic, Caption, Username.
 * [x] Optional: relative timestamp, like count, user profile image.
 * [x] Advanced: Add pull-to-refresh for popular stream with SwipeRefreshLayout.
 * [x] Advanced: Show latest comment for each photo (bonus: show last 2 comments).
 * [x] Advanced: Display each photo with the same style and proportions as the real Instagram.
 
Notes:

* Found issues getting a circular image using the suggested libraries, ended up just creating a transform. 

* Spent lots of time tweaking the UI so that it mimics instagram style.
